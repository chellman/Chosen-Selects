Overview
--------

[Chosen](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/) is a is a Javascript library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more friendly. It transforms both single select dropdowns and multiselect boxes. More information and demos at [http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/).

Chosen Selects is an [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com) fieldtype that brings Chosen to EE. At its core it is a simple Dropdown or Multiselect fieldtype, only the UI has been changed.


## Beta Status

The Chosen JS library is currently under active beta development, and therefore so is this fieldtype. Do not expect this to run in a production environment, but please do fork & contribute.
Currently there are a number of shortcomings, all of which will be addressed as Chosen progresses towards a 1.0 release.

Current shortcomings include:

* UI breaks if field is initially hidden in tab or collapsed
* No Matrix support
* Template tags have not been extensively tested

* ExpressionEngine 2
* PHP5
* jQuery 1.4+
* A modern browser: [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/), [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) or IE7+


## Changelog
